This repository holds the Task 6 I have complted for the Data Science &amp; Business Analytics Internship (GRIP July 21) provided by the [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)

### # Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Level - Intermediate)
Aim:
1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
